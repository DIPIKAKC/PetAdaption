            <h1>About us</h1>
            <p>Pet Adoption Website is Ireland and Northern Irelandâ€™s largest animal adoption portal, bringing together dogs, cats, and other animals available to adopt from rescues across Ireland.
                This means the public can view and apply to available animals in one place, rather than having to check each rescue individually.</p>

                <h4>How often is it updated?</h4>
                <p>It pulls directly from the rescue's own admin so it's updated in real time as the rescues make their changes.</p>

                <h4>Does it cost anything?</h4>

                <h4>How do I know the status of my application?</h4>
                <p>You will be contacted when a successful applicant is chosen. The animal's profile will update to tell you whether it is processing (i.e. the rescues are working through the applications) or if it has been reserved or adopted.</p>
